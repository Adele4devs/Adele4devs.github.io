        I am a student of AltSchool Africa, Department of Engineering. I studied
        Microbiology in college and I am here transitoning into a tech career. I
        know how cliche that sounds, almost everybody wants a slice of the tech
        cake for better job opportunities. Well, of course I want better job
        opportunities but I have a plan. I currently work as a Customer support
        agent for an Health Management Organisation (HMO). I am fascinated with
        the health sector and I am here to study frontend engineering with the
        sole aim (maybe not the "sole aim" since i already mentioned I also want
        better job opportunities, lol) of building and creating websites and
        applications that can help improve healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a curious but introverted perfectionist. I know what you are
        thinking, that combination does not go well and to be honest, it
        doesn't, but when I set my mind to achieve anything, I do not rest until
        I have achieved what I set out to do and not just achieve my goal but I
        strive be the best at it. I constantly strive to be better at everything
        I do. My life's philosophical rule is that "whatever is worth doing, is
        worth doing well". If it is worth my time, then I will give it my all in
        that time. Scary right? Yeah, it scares me too but it has brought me
        this far. Although I can see this might be quite challenging as there
        seem to be a large number of people who seem to already have an idea
        about software engineering, I am prepared as well so meet up with the
        requirements and surpass expectations I set for myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal in this comunity is to do the best I can at every juncture in
        this journey and ensure that I meet all the expectations I set for
        myself. I also look forward to teaming up with colleagues from the same
        scope and different scope to achieve a set goal and enhance networking
        after graduation.
